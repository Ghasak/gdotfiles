* helm icons

[[file:images/treemacs-icons.gif]]

** Configuration
*** Melpa (TBD)
*** Manual
By default, the provider uses =treemacs=, so make sure that you have that
in your load path. If you wish to use =all-the-icons= icons instead, set =helm-icons-provider=
to ='all-the-icons=. Or if you wish to use =nerd-icons= icons (which is usable in terminal,
more information [[https://github.com/rainstormstudio/nerd-icons.el][here]]), set =helm-icons-provider= to ='nerd-icons=. 

Make sure that you have =helm= and your icon provider installed, clone the repo
and put it on your path. Make sure that the enable call is performed before
loading =helm=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(helm-icons-enable)
#+END_SRC

If you use =all-the-icons= and you haven't installed the fonts before, you will be prompted to do so.

The following are images showing how it looks like when using with =nerd-icons=. Notice that
the second is in konsole.
